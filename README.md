**Gesture Detection System**

This repository contains code for a gesture detection system that detects a specific gesture within a video sequence. The system allows users to input an image or a short video clip representing the gesture, and then analyze a test video to determine whether the gesture occurs. If the gesture is detected, the system overlays the word "DETECTED" on the top right corner of the output frame(s).

**Requirements:**

The following Python libraries are required to run the code:
- opencv-python
- numpy
- Pillow

You can install these dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file provided in this repository. Simply run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. **Data Processing:**
   
   For data processing, the input data consists of an image representing the gesture to be detected and a video file in which the gesture detection will be performed. The data processing steps include:
   - Loading the image and video files using OpenCV.
   - Converting the input image and video frames to grayscale for template matching.
   - Preparing the input data for analysis by resizing the image and video frames if necessary.

2. **Model Selection/Development:**

   For this task, we use a template matching approach for gesture detection. Template matching is a simple and effective method for finding a template image within a larger image or video frame. In our implementation, we compare the grayscale representation of the gesture image with each frame of the input video to find matches.

3. **Detection Algorithm:**

   The detection algorithm involves the following steps:
   - Convert both the gesture image and video frames to grayscale.
   - Use template matching to compare the gesture image with each frame of the video.
   - Set a threshold to determine if a match is found. If the maximum correlation coefficient exceeds the threshold, consider the gesture detected.
   - Overlay the text "DETECTED" on the video frame where the gesture is detected.

4. **Annotation:**

   To annotate the video frames where the gesture is detected, we use the `cv2.putText()` function to overlay the text "DETECTED" at a specified position on the frame.

5. **Documentation:**

   The code provided in the implementation section demonstrates how the above steps are carried out. It includes functions to browse and select the image and video files, a main function to perform gesture detection, and a GUI created using Tkinter for user interaction.

   **Challenges:**
   - Ensuring accurate gesture detection: Adjusting the threshold for template matching and handling variations in gesture appearance and lighting conditions.
   - Optimizing performance: Efficiently processing video frames and minimizing processing time for real-time applications.
   - User interface design: Creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface for selecting files and displaying results.

   **Addressing Challenges:**
   - Experimentation with different threshold values and template matching methods to achieve accurate detection.
   - Optimizing code for performance, such as resizing images for faster processing and using efficient data structures.
   - Designing a clean and responsive user interface with clear instructions and feedback for the user.
